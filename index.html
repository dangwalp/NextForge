                <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-are-multimodal-large-language-models?msockid=0760374e6d506b552463224b6ca26ac8" target="_blank">
                    What Are Multimodal Large Language Models? - Azure
                </a>
                <p>This article explores Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which I find fascinating for their ability to combine text, images, and other data types. The potential for MLLMs to revolutionize how AI interacts with the world is truly exciting.</p>
            </li>

                <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/wavenet-a-generative-model-for-raw-audio/" target="_blank">
                    WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio - DeepMind
                </a>
                <p>DeepMind’s WaveNet model caught my attention because it represents a major breakthrough in generative audio models. Its ability to produce natural-sounding speech from raw audio is a powerful example of AI’s creative potential.</p>
